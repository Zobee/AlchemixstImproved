------PAGE TRANSITION------
*Aesthetic transition effect on page load, change. I'll need to do some testing to make sure it isn't too annoying to use. I really like how it looks, though. Not sure if I should use an image, or keep it as is.
*Added a function to generate a random hex code and get the b/w contrast for the background and text. I think it looks cool, but again, does it provide any value? Is there any substance to it?
*Refactored to make the shutters their own component. 

TODO:
*I'm gonna need to mess with the timing of the transition as well. It can't be too long, or too noticable.
*Maybe I should add a shutter up transition as well

------HEADER------
*Mobile responsive header with dropdown
*Created a bunch of header components: dropdown button, dropdown section
*Conditionally render one or the other based on screen size

TODO:
*I realized that I fucked up when I created the DT nav links, might need to refactor later
*Need to figure out Z-indexing for dropdown. Currently it slides in on top of the navbar
*Need to style it more. It looks a little amateurish, right now

------HOME PAGE------
*Super stylized header
*A metric fuckton of animations and transitions
*Social Media buttons
TODO: 
*Figure out how to make the header swap 
*Newest Track Link
*Email submission?

------STORE------
TODO: This is where the backend is going to come into play

------DRUM PAD------
TODO: I already know that my biggest issue is gonna be making this mobile responsive

------BACKEND------
